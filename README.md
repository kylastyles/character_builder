# Character Builder

Run with `python main.py`

Enter a whole number to build that many characters for your fictional narrative.
Randomization removes bias, hopefully increasing representation in stories.

Feel free to fork this repo and add/remove traits.

Tell me your stories!

### EXAMPLE:
```sh
$ python main.py
Please enter number of characters to build: 3
1. An old, male government employee with green eyes, dark brown hair, and light brown skin. He is selfish and also alone.
2. An old, female public servant with black eyes, black hair, and dark brown skin. She is friendly and also deaf.
3. A young, other gender retail employee with pink eyes, white hair, and albino skin. They are generous and also celebrated.
